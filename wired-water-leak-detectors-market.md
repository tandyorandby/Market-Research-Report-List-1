<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wired Water Leak Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Leak Detector</li><li>Active Leak Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wired water leak detectors can be categorized into two types: passive and active leak detectors. Passive leak detectors monitor specific areas using sensors that react to moisture, triggering alerts only when water is detected. They are typically less complex and suitable for continuous monitoring. In contrast, active leak detectors not only sense water presence but also automatically take action, such as shutting off the water supply or notifying users via alerts. This proactive approach enhances water damage prevention and operational efficiency.</p></p>
